# SurpriseHousingCaseStudy
A bike-sharing system is a service in which bikes are made available for shared use to individuals on a short term basis for a price or free. Many bike share systems allow people to borrow a bike from a "dock" which is usually computer-controlled wherein the user enters the payment information, and the system unlocks it. This bike can then be returned to another dock belonging to the same system.

## Problem Statement 
A US-based housing company named Surprise Housing has decided to enter the Australian market. The company uses data analytics to purchase houses at a price below their actual values and flip them on at a higher price. For the same purpose, the company has collected a data set from the sale of houses in Australia. The data is provided in the CSV file below.
<br>
The company is looking at prospective properties to buy to enter the market. You are required to build a regression model using regularisation in order to predict the actual value of the prospective properties and decide whether to invest in them or not.

<br>

### The company wants to know:
>• Which variables are significant in predicting the price of a house. <br>
>• How well those variables describe the price of a house.

<br>

## Objective 
> Build a model to determine the price of houses with the available independent variables. This model will then be used by the management to understand how exactly the prices vary with the variables. 
<br>


## Analysis Methodology
>• Importing and Understanding the data.<br>
>• Exploratory Data Analysis.<br>
>• Data Preparation for the Model.<br>
>• Splitting the data to Train & Test data set.<br>
>• Rescalling variables of the dataset using Min Max scalling.<br>
>• Building Models.<br>
>• Ridge Regression with best fit lambda. <br>
>• Ridge regression for different lambda values <br>
>• Lasso Regression with best fit lambda. <br>
>• Lasso regression for different lambda values <br>
>• Model Evaluation. <br>
>• Equation of the Best fRidge and Lasso model. <br>
>• Conclusions from the Model. <br>
